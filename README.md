# Music Recommendation System

The objective of this project is to develop a music recommendation system that predicts the
perceived appreciation of music based on Twitter analyses and user feedback. This will
involve leveraging contextual data from the nowplaying-RS dataset, which contains 11.6
million music listening events from 139K users and 346K tracks collected from Twitter.
Additionally, sentiment values associated with hashtags will be analyzed to understand the
emotional context.
